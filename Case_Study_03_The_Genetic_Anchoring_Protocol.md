# 📂 CASE STUDY 03: THE GENETIC ANCHORING PROTOCOL
**Archive_ID:** CS_03_D6U4Z8E4N
**Subject:** Weaponization of Innocence and Multi-Generational Emotional Exploitation
**Data Source:** WhatsApp Chat Log (Subject: Şahane)

---

## I. NEURAL RAPPORT HIJACKING
* **Mechanism**: Using a child (Şahane) to establish an emotional bridge based on protection and mentorship.
* **Neural Analysis**: The subject's Oxytocin levels are triggered through "caregiving" instincts, effectively bypassing the Prefrontal Cortex's defensive protocols against the primary manipulator (Sebiş).

## II. GEOGRAPHIC AND EMOTIONAL COGNITIVE MAPPING
* **Observation**: Information regarding "Gence City" (climate, size, facilities) provided via the child.
* **Effect**: This creates a "Reality Anchor" in the subject's mind. The abstract threat/love interest becomes a concrete physical destination, increasing the subject's commitment to the loop.

## III. THE "MERCY LIMIT" HYPOTHESIS
* **Conclusion**: The child is positioned as a tool for information and emotional leverage. The maternal figure's (Sebiş) mercy is strictly biological and strategic, used to secure the subject's resources while ignoring his psychological decay.
